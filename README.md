# Easy Setup for Development Purposes

In this project we are going to create an event-driven webhook that wakes up when a meeting transcript is uploaded to Cloud Storage, extracts action items using Gemini 3 Flash, and saves them to a NoSQL database (Firestore).

# Clone the Repo
It will open a new tab (make sure you are in the right email account), clone the repository, and enter the directory automatically.
